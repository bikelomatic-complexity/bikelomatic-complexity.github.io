The Adventure Cycling Association inspires and empowers people to travel by
bicycle. For cyclists who want to share their stories and for those who want
to research future tours, the Bicycle Touring Digital Companion (BTDC) is a
hybrid blogging and mapping application that publishes user stories alongside
route information and maps. The goal of the BTDC is to provide the bicycle
touring community with a unified platform for viewing, creating, and sharing
tour information. The BTDC will also aim to expand Adventure Cyclingâ€™s
membership by engaging younger cyclists and supporting a wide range of
experience levels. This new experience will be unlike any service that exists
today, where storytelling is kept separate from recorded trip data. Our users
will be able to view and create maps of their trips as well as find local
spots of interest. Users will be able to share routes and experiences through
narratives, and upload these narratives to the BTDC, where other users can
view them. All of the narratives and data accumulated in the application can
be stored and then later posted to provide cyclists an evolving diary of their
trip. These tools will come together into one platform, designed to inspire
more people to travel by bicycle.

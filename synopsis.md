The Adventure Cycling Association inspires and empowers people to travel by
bicycle. For cyclists who want to share their stories and for those who want
to research future tours, the Bicycle Touring Digital Companion (BTDC) is a
hybrid blogging and mapping application that publishes user stories alongside
route information and maps. The goal of the BTDC is to provide the bicycle
touring community with a unified platform for viewing, creating, and sharing
tour information. The BTDC will also aim to expand Adventure Cyclingâ€™s
membership by engaging younger cyclists and supporting a wide range of
experience levels. This new experience will be unlike any service that exists
today, where storytelling is kept separate from recorded trip data. Our users
will be able to view and create maps of their trips as well as find local
spots of interest. Users will be able to share routes and experiences through
narratives, and upload these narratives to the BTDC, where other users can
view them. All of the narratives and data accumulated in the application can
be stored and then later posted to provide cyclists an evolving diary of their
trip. These tools will come together into one platform, designed to inspire
more people to travel by bicycle.

However, For this senior project cycle, the RIT student team is not committed 
to implementing the entire vision of the system. The specific vision targeted 
by the team is outlined below

The Adventure Cycling Association inspires and empowers people to travel by 
bicycle. For cyclists who want a better experience while touring, the Bicycle 
Touring Digital Companion (BTDC) is a targeted mapping and service review 
application that allows cyclists to obtain information for services, points of 
interest, and alerts along bicycle touring routes in the United States. The goal 
of this phase of the BTDC development lifecycle is to provide value to users in 
the form of a unified and easily accessible database of service information. This 
access to service information will allow cyclists to more easily research and plan 
their tours, and allow cyclists to quickly modify their existing plans once they 
are on tour. Unlike other service review applications and tour maps, the information 
in the BTDC is both crowdsourced and specialized. This means that cyclists will 
avoid the struggle of sorting out the noise on other service review websites, 
and the difficulty of transporting and accessing physical touring maps. Cyclists 
will be able to add new points of interest and services to the database, 
review existing services, and track services along their current route. This 
iteration of the application is designed to provide value, even when standing 
alone from the system as a whole. As a result the student development team will 
be delivering this iteration of the BTDC as the minimum viable product.

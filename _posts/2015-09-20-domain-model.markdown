Our team has spent the first month of the semester starting up our project. We
began by meeting with our faculty coach and project sponsor for the first time.
You can learn more about [our team]({{site.baseurl}}/team) on the site.
We have also produced several deliverables that will serve to guide us the
rest of the year. We discuss these below.

# Domain Model

The domain model will provide a common understanding between us and our
project sponsor of the vocabulary and relationships common in the cycling
world. Below are links to our domain model.

    Welcome to Bikelomatic Complexity! This is the site for our senior project.
    We are working with Adventure Cycling to produce a web and mobile
    application to help cyclists document their experiences on tour. You can

    As the school year progresses, we will post project updates below. These
    updates will often contain deliverables required by the software engineering
    department at RIT.
